google-prettify-monokai-theme
==============================

An attempt to make a Google Code Prettify theme that looks like Sublime Text 2 Monokai Theme.

google-code-prettify (prettify.js) can be downloaded from here:
https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/

---

The theme is best for HTML codes.
For CSS, JS and others might not feel like Sublime Text 2's Monokai.

I'm still trying to figure out a way to declare a specific .css file for each language, so I can make other monokai themes respecting ST2's each language color.
