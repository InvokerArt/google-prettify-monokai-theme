google-prettify-monokai-theme
==============================

An attempt to make a Google Code Prettify theme that looks like Sublime Text 2 Monokai Theme.

google-code-prettify (prettify.js) can be downloaded from here:
https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/

---

The theme is best for HTML codes.
For CSS, JS and others might not feel like Sublime Text 2's Monokai.


---
## To do:
An addition to the .CSS to support the `class="lang-*"` that prettify supports, for correct colouring CSS and JS just like ST's language colors.
